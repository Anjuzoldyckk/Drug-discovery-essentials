GitHub README Description
Here is a template you can use for your README.md file on GitHub.

Docking Results to IC50 Converter ðŸ”¬
A simple yet powerful Python script to extract molecular docking results (compound name and binding energy) from a Microsoft Word (.docx) file, calculate the corresponding pIC50 and IC50 values, and export the data into a clean CSV file.

Features âœ¨
Parses .docx Files: Directly reads tables from a Word document, eliminating the need for manual copy-pasting.

Automated Calculations: Converts binding energy (kcal/mol) to pIC50 and IC50 (Molar).

Error Handling: Gracefully skips rows with invalid or missing data.

Structured Output: Generates a tidy, analysis-ready .csv file.

How It Works ðŸ§ª
The script uses two key pharmacological formulas for its conversions:

Binding Energy to pIC50: The pIC50 is estimated from the binding free energy (
DeltaG) using the following approximation, which is valid at room temperature (298K):

$$$$$$pIC50 \\approx -\\frac{\\Delta G (\\text{kcal/mol})}{1.364} $$
$$$$

pIC50 to IC50: The IC50 value (in Molar concentration) is calculated from the pIC50 using its standard definition:

$$$$$$IC50 (M) = 10^{-pIC50} $$
$$$$

Usage Guide ðŸš€
1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. You will need to install the python-docx library.

Bash

pip install python-docx
2. Input File Format
Create a Microsoft Word file named binding enrgy.docx in the same directory as the script.

Inside the document, create a table with at least two columns.

The first column should contain the Compound Name.

The second column should contain the Binding Energy (in kcal/mol).

The script is designed to skip the header row of the table.

Example Input Table in binding enrgy.docx:

Compound Name	Binding Energy (kcal/mol)
Compound-A	-9.8
Compound-B	-10.5
Compound-C	-8.2

Export to Sheets
3. Run the Script
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the script's directory, and run:

Bash

python your_script_name.py
4. Check the Output
The script will generate a file named results_from_docx.csv.

Example results_from_docx.csv Output:
