1. Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. You will need to install the python-docx library.

pip install python-docx
2. Input File Format
Create a Microsoft Word file named binding enrgy.docx in the same directory as the script.

Inside the document, create a table with at least two columns.

The first column should contain the Compound Name.

The second column should contain the Binding Energy (in kcal/mol).

The script is designed to skip the header row of the table.

Compound Name	Binding Energy (kcal/mol)
Compound-A	-9.8
Compound-B	-10.5
Compound-C	-8.2

Export to Sheets
3. Run the Script
Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the script's directory, and run:

Bash

python your_script_name.py
4. Check the Output
The script will generate a file named results_from_docx.csv.

Example results_from_docx.csv Output:
